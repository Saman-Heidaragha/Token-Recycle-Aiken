# T-Recycle Smart Contract for Cardano

The Token-Recycle project is a blockchain-based solution designed to manage recycling activities on the Cardano network. It leverages the efficiency of Aiken, a game changing programming language optimized for writing smart contracts and aims to utilize a Layer 2 solution like Hydra for scalability and real-world application.

## Project Idea
The goal of Token-Recycle is to create a transparent and secure system for encouraging recycling. Participants are rewarded for their contributions, ensuring accountability and fostering sustainable practices. By utilizing Cardano's UTXO model, the contract guarantees fairness and immutability in the recycling process.
